A Telegram bot that interfaces with a self-hosted [Readeck](https://readeck.org/) instance to manage bookmarks.
It's based on the [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) framework.

Features:

- /register (create a new user) or /token to register the bot with an existent user
- Save bookmarks by sending a URL (with optional title and tags).
- Read. Create a simplified version of the article in telegra.ph
- /md_<id> return the raw markdown
- /list  . unread articles
- /epub generate an epub with the unread articles
- /version show the current bot version
- /restart restart the bot process (for upgrades, requires systemd or similar process manager)


## Run via Docker Compose (Recommended)

You can easily run the bot using Docker and GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). Create a `docker-compose.yml` file anywhere on your machine with the following content:

```yaml
services:
  readeckbot:
    image: ghcr.io/mgaitan/readeckbot:latest # Change to your repo name if you fork it or any version tag you want to use.
    container_name: readeckbot
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file: .env
    working_dir: /app/data
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
```

Then, create a `.env` file in the same directory:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<your_bot_token>
READECK_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
READECK_CONFIG=./config.yaml      # optional, can be left out
READECK_DATA=./data               # optional, use if you want to customize where data is stored

LLM_KEY=<your_llm_key>           # optional, use if you want to enable LLM features
LLM_MODEL=<model_name>           # optional, by default it's gemini-2.0-flash-lite
LLM_SUMMARY_MAX_LENGTH=<int>     # optional , use if you want to customize the max length of LLM summary
```

Start the bot:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Setup a development environment

**1. Clone the bot repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mgaitan/readeckbot.git
cd readeckbot
```

**2. Download the Readeck binary**

Download the appropriate binary for your system from the official site: https://readeck.org/en/download

Place the `readeck` binary **in the same directory as the bot code**.

**3. Start the Readeck API server in a console**

Open a terminal and run

```bash
./readeck serve
```

or `readeck.exe serve` on Windows

This will start the Readeck backend on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default.


**4. Set up your environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the project root (same format as the [Docker Compose section](#run-via-docker-compose-recommended)).

> 📄 What’s a `.env` file? It's a simple file format for storing key=value pairs, that are loaded as [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) by apps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep in mind that, initially, **we will be working with two different 'tokens'**.
>
> On one hand, there's the one we set in the `.env` file for the **Telegram bot**; on the other, there's the authentication **token specific to Readeck**.
> If you’re having issues when trying to use `/register`, it’s likely that you're missing the latter.
>
> An easy way to resolve this is by going to the URL where you're hosting Readeck, then navigating to **Settings → API**.
> There you can generate the authentication token and then use it in the Telegram chat with the command `/token <your_readeck_token>`.

**5. Get your own Telegram bot token**

To connect your bot to Telegram, you’ll need to create a bot and get its API token.

- Open Telegram and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
- Run `/newbot` and follow the prompts.
- Copy the token it gives you and paste it into your `.env` file under `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`

**6. Run the bot in development mode**

This project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a fast Python package manager and runner.

> Don't have it yet? Install it from here: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation

Then in another terminal run the bot:

```bash
uv run --extra llm readeckbot
```

The first time it will install Python and the depenencies as needed and can take a bit, but
that’s it!

You can now start chatting with your bot on Telegram using your own token.

### Special commands for bot management

- `/version` — Replies with the current version of the bot (from the code).
- `/restart` — Restarts the bot process. This is useful for upgrades: if you run the bot under `systemd` (or similar), it will be relaunched and pick up the latest version (for example, if you use `uvx` to always run the latest code).  
  **Note:** You may want to restrict this command to admin users in production.
